Neuroshare Bindings for Matlab
==============================

Overview
--------

This software package allows the use of Neuroshare Libraries from Matlab.


Installation
------------

Precompiled packages can be obtained from:
	    https://github.com/G-Node/nsmatlab/archives/master

Add the directory containing the Matlab script files (*.m) and the 'mexprog'
library to Matlab path. See the Matlab documentation how to do so:
	http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/path.html

In addition to that the Neuroshare vendor DLLs must be obtained and installed.
A (possible incomplete and outdated) list of available DLLs can be found at the
Neuroshare homepage:
	   http://neuroshare.sourceforge.net/DLLLinks.shtml


Usage
-----

The both examples 'Example' and 'ExampleAnalog' contained in the
'Examples' directory can be used as a demonstration of how to 
use Neuroshare from Matlab and thus provide a good starting point
to develop custom scripts.

The full documentation of the API can be found here:
